# Welcome to my Thesis Lab! 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Here you can find a collection of Jupiter Notebooks full of Python code and nice visualizations that were used for my thesis in Econometrics/Machine Learning. The project is devided in three parts:*

## [Part 1](https://github.com/nikosga/Thesis/blob/master/Part%201__Data%20Cleaning.ipynb)
In this part the initial datasets are cleaned up so that they can be used for analysis
## [Part 2](https://github.com/nikosga/Thesis/blob/master/Part%202__Regression%20Techniques.ipynb)
Constructing a model that predicts happiness while testing some algorithms on the way
## [Part 3](https://github.com/nikosga/Thesis/blob/master/Part%203__Predicting%20the%20past.ipynb)
Predicting how happy were people back in the day.
