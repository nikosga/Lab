# Welcome to my Thesis Lab! 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Here you can find a collection of Jupiter Notebooks full of Python code and nice visualizations that were used for my thesis in Econometrics/Machine Learning. The project is devided in three parts:*

## Part 1
In this part the initial datasets are cleaned up so that they can be used for analysis
## Part 2
Let's make a model that predicts happiness while testing some algorithms on the way
## Part 3
Predicting how happy were people back in the day.
