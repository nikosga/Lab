    "This train is reaching it's destination. In the previous parts it became obvious that using Machine Learning algorithms and specifically ensemble methods can offer highly accurate predictive models. It is commonly accepted that even though ML offers greater predictive capacity than classical techniques in statistics in many situations, it is inferior when it comes to interpretation and contribution to scientific theory. It is also a fact that even though ML is being widely used in many scientific fields, Economists are skeptical in adding ML to their toolbox. In his [paper](http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hal/Papers/2013/ml.pdf), Hal Varian argues that ML can provide useful insights for Economists, that linear models are uncapable of. In this part, a decision tree will be used to provide answers that will lead to better public policy and a comparison will be made with a linear model. In particular, the following questions will be answered:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How happiness is affected by income?\n",
    "* How can we classify countries with respect to their happiness levels?"

    "* Top-Down interpretation: The features that are used as criteria in the top of the tree are considered by the model as more crucial and general, compared to those in the lower levels of the tree. \n",
    "* Color-tone interpretation: The brighter coloured nodes represent higher levels of the dependent variable (happiness)\n",
    "* From previous chapters it was made clear that GDP per capita plays a major role in happiness. The linear model fails to pinpoint the exact impact it has on happiness since the effect of DGP per capita is evenly spread in all happiness levels. By interpreting it's partial coefficient we can state that, keeping other things constant, for a unit increase in GDP per capita we have a 0.26 of a unit increase in a country's happiness on average. This is quite misleading and its impact was strong since GDP was used as the main indicator of well-being. This is not the case in our decision tree since it's made clear that GDP per capita should be used as a criterion for values under 30K $. The first branch seperates countries in 2 categories wrt to their GDP per capita status and then it's used again in the next branch. This shows the relevance of GDP per capita in countries with values under 30K. On the contrary, countries with values over this threshold should focus their policy on other measures of development. \n",
    "* Starting from left to right we can classify the countries in the following categories with respect to the criteria they meet. The first category are the countries that struggle with vitality issues. Countries that people don't reach ages over 65 due to health, hunger or war. They don't have access to clean water or food. They belong to the lowest happiness level. In the next level we have countries that face different types of problems. They have high levels of unemployment and even if they don't face the same problems with the previous category they are still considered unhappy. Next, we find countries that can be separated with respect to their exports and  especially to high income economies. Searching more on these countries we find that the ones with high levels of exports in high income economies produce mainly machinery equipment and chemicals while those with lower levels of that variable export coal, petroleum and oil. So this variable can be considered an instrument of higher education in the workforce.  The last category contains countries that have fulfilled the previous targets and focus to higher level values such as respect, equality and justice to name but a few. Additional income isn't likely to increase their hapiness and so their policy should have different goals. \n",
    "* While the first categories need to pay attention in increasing their GDP, this is not the case for the countries belonging in the higher happiness level categories. Seats held by women in national parliaments is used as an instrument to measures the difference that countries have in the organization of their society and their quality of values. Specifically, we can see that the increase in happiness by increasing the life expectancy in the lower levels is more or less the same with the increase in happiness by paying attention to the values of the societies in higher levels of happiness."
